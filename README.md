# Xamarin Weather
This is just a very small application I used to test how to make a small Xamarin application, since I'd never done any. It gets data from the OpenWeather API and shows the current weather in Seville, and the forecast for 4 days every 3 hours. The History is still a WIP.

It uses MVVM pattern, and binding for all the data. Since my Final Project for my grade was made in WPF and I've some experience with .NET, it wasn't too difficult to understand how Xamarin works.
